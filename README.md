**Cement Prediction Model using Linear Regression**

**Introduction:**

This repository contains a predictive model for estimating the compressive strength of cement using Linear Regression. The model is built upon historical data of various cement samples along with their corresponding compressive strengths. 

**Files Included:**

1. **concrete_data.csv**: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training the model. It includes features such as cement composition, age, and other relevant parameters, along with the target variable, which is the compressive strength.

2. **Cement_Prediction_Model.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code used to develop and train the linear regression model. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model for future use.

3. **requirements.txt**: This file lists all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the code successfully.

4. **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the repository and instructions for running the model.

**Usage:**

To use the Cement Prediction Model, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sumitcoder01/cement_strength_prediction_model.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```
   cd cement_prediction_model
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:** Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `Cement_strength_prediction.ipynb` file. Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

4. **Input Data:** If you want to make predictions on new data, ensure it follows the same format as the provided dataset (`concrete_data.csv`). The model expects features such as cement composition, age, etc., as input.

5. **Save and Load Model (Optional):** Once trained, the model will be saved as a file (e.g., `pipe.pkl`). You can load this model in your Python code for making predictions without retraining.

**References:**

Include any relevant papers, articles, or resources that were used in building the model.
